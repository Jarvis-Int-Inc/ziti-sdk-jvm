# Accessing Postgres via Ziti

This sample will illustrate the commands needed to setup a test environment using docker as well as provide some sample code showing you how to access the postgres instance using the JRE sdk through the Ziti overlay network.

See the [cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.md) for the commands necessary to run the sample.

Watch a [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2KlFXDQxvo) illustrating the process

Reminder - the demo requires you to be able to address ziti-edge-controller and ziti-edge-router. The easiest way to do that is by updating your hosts file but feel free to do it any way you see fit! :)
